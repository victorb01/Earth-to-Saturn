# Earth-to-Saturn
Project coded as part of the Applied Orbital Mechanics course at University of Texas at Austin. Its goal is to find the family of zero-radius patched conic trajectories between Earth and Saturn with a Jupiter flyby, using a fixed launch time and a total time of flight of 2000 days or less.
